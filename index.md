## Summary

I am the Upstream IDA’s focal point for wells & reservoir projects, developing data science projects, and supporting colleagues translate analytics into engineering and management language.
My professional engineering background is supported by further academic education in operational research and management sciences.
Out of the office I enjoy spending time with my family, powerlifting, trekking and cycling throughout Den Haag.

`Feb 2017 - Aug 2018`
__New Energies Researcher__
| University of Bath School of Management, _Bath - UK_

My research extends the risk-return relationship, from the portfolio optimisation theory, for energy demand aggregation based on time-series forecasting.
I hypothesise that a portfolio of customers, chosen through maximising the forecast accuracy, would be an ideal trading object within a peer-to-peer energy marketplace.
- Responsible for designing an evolutionary optimisation model for time-series applications, using R
- Collaborated with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering to develop a smart-grid energy model for the UK and Korea peer-to-peer energy trading project
- Presenting and participating in several forecasting forums and UK power industry conferences.

`Apr 2014 - Dec 2016`
__Production & Reservoir Engineer__
| Petrobras Ultra-Deep Waters, _Rio de Janeiro - Brazil_

**Reservoir simulation:** Within a team of engineers and geologists, developed and maintained a reservoir simulation process for the supergiant Lula oilfield (340 thousand barrels per day). This model supported strategic decision making, production forecasting and investment optimisation.
- Designed a machine learning oil/water permeability model for the oilfield implementing clustering and classification algorithms on Weka
- Delivered the 2016 oil reserves estimation (2.3 billion barrels) to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian regulatory agency, using CMG GEM, Excel and VBA

**Production forecast:** Responsible for the oil production estimation of seven multi-billion projects.
- Collaborated with stakeholders such as project managers, executive board and the regulatory agency
- Developed and maintained a sixteen-month ahead forecasting model on Excel, comprising seven offshore platforms and over 30 wells connected to the same gas pipeline infrastructure, with more than 95\% accuracy
- Created a framework for data pre-processing, integration and communication of project premises such as operational schedule of wells, maintenance program and asset availability
- Assessed the risk of different production estimations for the decision-making process using Excel @Risk.

**Resource management:** Coordinated a team of three engineers responsible for the resource allocation of submarine equipment and vessels for 15 projects (10\% of total capital cost).
- Presented the monthly resource optimisation strategy to head management for appraisal, before submission to procurement
- Created an Excel decision support model for evaluating impact of resource allocation changes, and liaised with project managers to deliver the optimal production output for the portfolio
- Under my coordination, a team of three engineers was responsible for the resource allocation of submarine equipment and vessels for 15 projects (10\% of total capital cost) liaising with stakeholders to optimise the oil production for the portfolio

[comment]: # (Programmed the activity of eight vessels in an in-house scheduling platform, connecting 25 ultra-deep wells in 2015, and reducing the average idle time in 5%.)

`Apr 2009 - Apr 2014`
__Industrial Engineer__
| Petrobras Refining, _Rio de Janeiro - Brazil_

Responsible for the corporate supply chain management governance of 12 units throughout the nation, and for liaising with asset management teams.
- Optimised spare parts' inventory, looking at the failure history of assets, production security, material costs and logistics, through survival analysis modelling and Monte Carlo simulation
- Developed and implemented a shared inventory model for high-cost, low-demand spare-parts, through soft systems methodology (SSM) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) - published on the Journal of the Operational Research Society (UK). This initiative, associated with inventory optimisation, allowed the reduction of inventory value from US\$ 5.7 to US\$ 4.2 million
- Built a model to assess the gasoline distribution costs between refineries, terminals and Brazilian regions, considering ships, trucks and pipelines - published in Brazilian Symposium of Operational Research
- Liaised with maintenance, reliability and engineering teams to develop the first version of the Predictive Maintenance Supply Planning Standard for Petrobras Refining Division, supporting 12 refineries
- Responsible for the supply chain dashboard for the refinery system, using SAP ERP and BI data
% Designed inventory outsourcing contracts for 6 refineries
% Member of the refining inventory demobilisation team, negotiating the return of USD 16 million in stock value of unused spare-parts to suppliers
