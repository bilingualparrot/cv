I am currently a Product/Data Analyst on the Upstream IDA team. The bulk of my work revolves around reservoir and well engineering projects for nearly all assets under Unconventionals. For this work, I apply analytics and programming skills to complex engineering problems, working closely with the business and subject matter experts to understand the task at hand. Additionally, as the lead developer for these projects, I manage the project documentation, maintain communication and ties, identify opporutnities to collaborate with other teams within Shell, and market the IDA team's work across Shell via presentations and other mediums.
Out of work, I spend a lot of time doing indoor climbing, reading & writing, photography, traveling, and keeping up to date with various industry and business trends as well as politics.
